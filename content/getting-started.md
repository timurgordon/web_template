# Getting Started

To use this repository as a template, simply:

- clone repository
- [install Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/),
- run `npm install` to install dependencies
- run `npm run start`

The site will be built on localhost:1111 where you can preview your changes locally.

## Customizing Site

It is recommended that you customize the font, metadata, logo and favicon of your site.

## Adding Content

You can edit and add your own content from content directory. Each direct .md child file of the content directory will route to the url of the filename. By default, \_index.md will be your landing page.

## Pushing to git

In order to keep fetching updates from the template and yet still be able to deploy site from a different github repository, it is recommended that you keep the remote origin of the template and add your own remote repository.
